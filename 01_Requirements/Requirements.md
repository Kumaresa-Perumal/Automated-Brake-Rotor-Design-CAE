# Automotive Brake Rotor – Design Requirements

## Project Objective
Design and validate an inboard vented automotive brake rotor with a heat dam
using parametric CAD, automation, and thermal analysis.

## Application
- Passenger vehicle (front axle)
- Disc brake system
- Cast iron brake rotor

## Rotor Type
- Inboard vented
- Integrated heat dam to reduce heat transfer to hub

## Functional Requirements
- Efficient heat dissipation during braking
- Structural integrity under braking torque
- Reduced heat conduction to wheel hub
- Manufacturable via casting and machining

## Preliminary Design Parameters (Initial)
- Outer Diameter: 260–300 mm
- Inner Diameter: 140–160 mm
- Disc Thickness: 22–28 mm
- Number of Vents: 30–40
- Heat Dam Thickness: 3–6 mm
- Mounting Holes: 5
- Pitch Circle Diameter (PCD): 100–114.3 mm

## Material (Assumed)
- Grey Cast Iron
- High thermal conductivity
- Good wear resistance

## Exclusions
- CFD airflow analysis
- Fatigue life prediction
- Full vehicle brake system modeling
