# OEM Brake Rotor Benchmarking Study

## Objective
To study existing OEM automotive brake rotors and extract design logic related
to thermal management, manufacturability, and structural integrity.

---

## Rotor Types Observed
Most OEM passenger vehicles use vented brake rotors on the front axle to
improve heat dissipation under repeated braking.

Common observations:
- Front rotors are typically vented
- Rear rotors may be solid or vented depending on vehicle class

---

## Vent Geometry Analysis
OEM rotors commonly use:
- Straight radial vents for manufacturing simplicity
- Curved vents in performance-oriented designs to improve airflow

Vents are primarily located closer to the friction ring to maximize convective
cooling effectiveness.

---

## Heat Dam Design Observations
- Heat dams are commonly integrated between the friction ring and rotor hat
- Thickness transitions are smooth to avoid stress concentration
- Heat dam geometry increases the thermal path to reduce heat conduction
  into the hub and wheel bearings

---

## Hat and Mounting Design
- Rotor hats are thicker near mounting regions for structural rigidity
- Fillets are applied at hat–disc junctions to reduce stress
- Bolt hole regions are reinforced locally

---

## Manufacturing Considerations
- Uniform wall thickness is maintained where possible
- Sharp corners are avoided in internal vent regions
- Designs are optimized for casting followed by machining

---

## Key Takeaways for This Project
- Inboard vented design is suitable for thermal performance
- Heat dam integration is critical for hub temperature reduction
- Smooth transitions and fillets are essential for durability
- Geometry must balance cooling performance and manufacturability
