# Brake Heat Generation – Fundamentals

## Importance of Thermal Management
During braking, the kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into thermal
energy due to friction between the brake pads and the rotor. Excessive heat
can cause brake fade, rotor cracking, and damage to nearby components.

## Source of Brake Heat
The heat generated during braking comes from the conversion of kinetic energy:

E = 1/2 × m × v²

Where:
- m = vehicle mass
- v = vehicle velocity

## Heat Distribution in a Disc Brake System
Typical assumptions for a passenger car braking event:
- ~70% of braking energy is absorbed by the front axle
- ~85–90% of that energy is absorbed by the brake rotor
- Remaining energy is absorbed by pads and caliper

## Heat Transfer Mechanisms in Brake Rotors

### Conduction
Heat flows through the rotor material and into the hat and hub.

### Convection
Heat is dissipated to surrounding air, enhanced by vented rotors.

### Radiation
Minor contribution and neglected in this project.

## Role of Heat Dam
A heat dam reduces conductive heat transfer from the friction ring to the rotor
hat, protecting wheel bearings and improving durability.
